The Low Entropy Model Specification language. This repository contains the [Schema](https://github.com/LEMS/LEMS/tree/master/Schemas/LEMS) for the language, some [examples](https://github.com/LEMS/LEMS/tree/master/examples) and code for [generating the documentation](https://github.com/LEMS/LEMS/tree/master/docgeneration).
