This is an attempt to make a Schema file to validate the structure of a LEMS document.

Currently it is limited to a subset of LEMS as used to define the NeuroML 2 elements, 
and so NeuroML2CoreTypes/Cells.xml etc. can be validated against this (see 
https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/tree/master/NeuroML2CoreTypes).
